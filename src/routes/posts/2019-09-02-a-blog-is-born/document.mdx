The term "blog" never quite sat right with me. It sounds too much like the word "bog", which--regardless of where you're from--isn't pleasant. 

I'd like to think of this more as a space for experimentation. Perhaps it's a place to develop my writing voice, discuss various topics that I'm currently interested in, or even "tweet" a short thought. It might grow wings, horns, or even a tail. Regardless, I'm curious to see how it develops organically over time.

My editor doesn't have a spellchecker, so forgive me in advance.
