# Background

This has been in the making for about 3 years now. Ever since I graduated college, I have made numerous attempts to create a personal website. 
Each was an attempt at reinventing the wheel. I felt that building something from the ground up was the most genuine way to build a personal website. But just because something isn’t built from scratch, doesn’t mean there isn’t ingenuity in the way it's pulled together. The same thinking should apply to building a personal website. 

Tools for easily building websites have been available to the public for a few decades. Sites like AngelFire, Tripod, and GeoCities made it possible for nearly anyone with internet access to leave a digital footprint. Today, there are more powerful website building tools such as Squarespace, WordPress, and Wix. When I set out to build my personal website I wanted to make something without utilizing any of these tools. I assumed that building something from scratch was a rite of passage to becoming an established software engineer. After finally launching my personal website, I realize this is not the case.

In honor of my first post, I wanted to recount some of the attempts that led me here.

# 2016: Dynamic Blog Builder

I set out to build a dynamic blog builder in hopes that this would help launch my personal website, and many others. I took inspiration from sites like Blogger, Wikipedia, and Tumblr; and as such, wanted to build something just as ambitious. I wanted to build something abstract enough so that anybody could reuse it. Having just graduated from college, it only felt nature to make something that was perfectly engineered for every use case. However, my primary goal was to build a personal website for _me_, not the rest of the world. I bogged myself down with the endless possiblilities on how I could make the experience more customized.

### Basic Architecture

The frontend client was built using PHP, JQuery, and Twig. It handled reading and editing blog posts from a user-specific editor. The backend API was built also using PHP connecting to a MySQL database. I chose this stack due to having built something very similar to this in college and ported it over with ease.

Within a couple of days, I had this:

As soon as I had the thing working, I got bogged down in adding support for a home-brewed wiki markdown parser. I figured that if I couldn’t build blog pages without implementing a sophisticated tool like [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io/), then it wasn’t ready for the world. I eventually abandoned the project shortly after. There were no deadlines, so there was no reason for me to keep pushing forward.

# 2017: React

I learned about React in mid 2017, and wanted to make a second attempt at building a personal website with it. I found numerous boilerplate options I could bootstrap the new version of my personal website with, such as [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [bloggie](https://github.com/lestard/bloggie), and [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate). Most of them were bloated for my purposes, including support for technologies such as GraphQL. I bootstrapped implementations with various boilerplates, but each time I reached a working product, I got bogged down again with adding sophisticated support for tangential features. I constantly abandoned implementations because I couldn’t support easily adding photos, formatting code snippets, and editing blog posts. I think a lot of it had to do with the quest for perfection. Ironically, what I had at that point was sufficient for _my_ personal website.

# 2018: Simplicity is Key

It was not until 2018 that I learned I only needed a fraction of the infrastructure I had built. A coworker of mine told me that he his blog ran on static HTML. All of his posts were stored as raw HTML strings in text files. The concept of having no client/server relationship and no database in a web application was foreign to me. I thought every legitimate application today required a database.

# 2019: Success

I got realistic about my website’s requirements:
- _I_ would be the only person adding content
- Content would be mostly _static_ HTML 
- Everything happen _client-side_

I stopped thinking about how I could apply all the new and interesting technologies, patterns, and ideas I wanted to learn about to building a personal website, and started thinking about the actual content I could post there. 

This year I discovered [create-react-blog](https://github.com/jamesknelson/create-react-blog), which checked off all these boxes. Its entire workflow for creating and deploying blog posts was the simplest I’d seen. `create-react-blog` requires minimal user setup before deploying. Having a nearly out of the box solution allowed me to focus on a step I had never reached before: deploying something to the web.

I was fine with not having built the application from scratch because `create-react-blog` gives me enough flexibility to feel like I’m still in control of how the application functions. The process for writing and deploying posts is technical as well. I’ve even since overhauled the entire design of the website to feel like my own.

### Uncharted Territory

Having a functioning personal website was only part of the challenge. I still needed a domain name and a place to host my personal website. I was lucky enough to be able to purchase  `shawncruz.com`  through SiteGround. I deployed my personal website to a DigitalOcean Droplet. Both of these processes were relatively painless. I am eager to see how this setup continues to work for me.

# Next Steps

I plan to continue improving the design and appearance of my personal website. I place high importance on not only the content I post, but also the way that it’s presented visually. Most importantly, I want to keep coming up with ideas to write about. I aim to accumulate enough decent content so that I can eventually put this on my professional resume.
