The other day I was in such deep thought that I walked directly into a turnstile. Mind you, I was entering the subway. 
The kicker was that I forgot I needed to pay before entering. Reality hit me swiftly in my center of gravity.
Thankfully it was just a waste-high turnstile [^5], and not the kind that would’ve turned me into deli meat[^6].
