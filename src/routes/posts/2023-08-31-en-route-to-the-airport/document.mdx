**4:30am** *Glad my alarm woke me up. Shouldn't need to pack much else. Just need to take the trash out and make sure everything's off before I leave. Shit, didn't realize that thing is broken; need to fix it when I get back. It's 60 this morning; I should wear a longsleeve.*

**5:30am.** *I'm hungry. Glad I packed sandwiches. I'll have one on the subway. The air is nice and cool this morning. Summer's almost over.*

**5:50am.** *It's the local train and there are no open seats. Look at all these people; I wonder what they do. There's air in this car, but I'm sweating. \*Guy next to me spits on the ground and stomps on it with his slides\*. I'll save those sandwiches for later.*

**6:15am.** *Just got to Jamaica Station. Have to catch the Airtrain. Didn't realize they had a Tim Hortons here. The smell makes me want a coffee and at least one donut. But I packed sandwiches, so maybe another time.*

**6:45am.** *Security was quick. I've got about 2 hours to kill before boarding. I'm tired, but I probably shouldn't nap. I think I'll have a sandwich.*
