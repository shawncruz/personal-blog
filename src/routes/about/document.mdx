# About

I’m a software engineer based in NYC. I graduated from Stony Brook University with a B.S. in Computer Science. I’m mainly interested in topics such as Distributed Systems, Database Theory, UI/UX, and the social aspects of being a software engineer. Besides software engineering, I’m also interested in music, playing the guitar, music theory, art, sci-fi, and skateboarding.
