# About

I'm a software engineer based in New York City. The majority of my professional experience has been in developing 3rd party integrations, back-end APIs, and front-end UIs for SaaS companies. I tend to thrive at mission-driven companies that highly value teamwork, transparency, and communication. On the other hand, I also value personal time and space away from work. I've grown to appreciate all aspects of software engineering, ranging from building real-time data pipelines to people management. At times, I feel like the title "software engineer" puts me in a box that I can't grow out of--one that doesn't properly label my strengths. I think my perspective on software engineering is unique, because my interests range far beyond what is expected of a typical software engineer.

Besides software engineering, I enjoy making and listening to music; playing the guitar; the genres of Sci-Fi and History; and skateboarding.

### Credits

I'd like to recognize all of the influences that inspired the theme of my personal website. It can be really difficult to create an image for how you want to represent yourself. For inspiration, I typically look at the things that are within arm's reach: a subway line, album artwork, jacket colorways, graffiti color palettes. 

Listed below are some of the things that helped me build this vision:

- [create-react-blog](https://github.com/jamesknelson/create-react-blog): Bootstrapped this website
- [David Tate's Blog](https://blog.davidtate.org/): Inspired my current website theme
- [Erik Terwan's Hamburger Menu](https://codepen.io/Joanc/pen/XYYZdE): Bootstrapped my hamburger menu
- [Tempa](http://www.tempa.co.uk/): Inspired my logo
