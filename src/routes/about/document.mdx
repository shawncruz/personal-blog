# About

I’m a software engineer based in New York City. I thrive at mission-driven companies that highly value teamwork, transparency, and communication. The majority of my professional experience has been in developing 3rd party integrations, back-end APIs, and front-end UIs for SaaS companies. Additionally, I’ve grown to appreciate broader aspects of software engineering, such as people management.


## Credits

Much credit is due to the influences that helped me stitch together a personal website that most closely represents me. These are the sources that helped me build this vision:

- [create-react-blog](https://github.com/jamesknelson/create-react-blog): Bootstrapped this website
- [Tempa](https://www.discogs.com/label/6170-Tempa): Inspired my logo
- [7 Train](http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/sevenlin.htm): Inspired the color theme of my logo and website
