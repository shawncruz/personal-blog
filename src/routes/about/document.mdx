# About

I’m a software engineer based in New York City. I thrive at mission-driven companies that highly value teamwork, transparency, and communication. The majority of my professional experience has been in developing 3rd party integrations, back-end APIs, and front-end UIs for SaaS companies. However, I’ve grown to appreciate the broader aspects of software engineering, ranging from building real-time data pipelines to people management.
